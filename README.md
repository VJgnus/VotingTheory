# VotingTheory

The Ranked Pairs method is a voting system that elects the candidate who is the winner of the most head-to-head contests against the other candidates, where the head-to-head contests are determined by the preferences of the voters. This function takes a voting profile and the number of candidates and creates a dictionary to store the number of times each pair of candidates defeats each other. Then it iterates through the voting profile and compares the preferences of each pair of candidates. For each voter, the function compares the position of candidate i and candidate j in the voter's preferences, and if candidate i is ranked higher than candidate j, the function increments the number of wins for candidate i against candidate j. It then creates a list of all possible head-to-head contests between candidates and sorts the contests by the number of wins. Then it initialize an empty list to store the beatpath ordering, an empty set to keep track of the candidates that have been added to the beatpath, and iterate through the sorted contests, adding the winner to the beatpath if they haven't been added yet. Finally, it returns the beatpath ordering

The Plurality method is a voting system that elects the candidate who receives the most votes. This function takes a voting profile and the number of candidates, and creates a dictionary to count the number of votes for each candidate. Then, it iterates through the voting profile and counts the votes for each candidate by counting the number of times a candidate is listed as the first preference of the voter. Finally, it finds the candidate with the highest number of votes by using the built-in max function with a key function that extracts the number of votes for each candidate, and returns that candidate as the winner.
